# CURRICULUM.md — C × DSA Roadmap v3, Stage-by-Stage Specification

**Status:** Definitive content spec · the companion to PLAN.md · this is what gets encoded as typed data
**Audience:** Total beginner (very low C experience). Every stage defines its own vocabulary.
**Pacing reference:** ~3 h weekdays, ~6–7 h Sunday. Day budgets assume that rhythm.

**Per-stage template** (used for all 19 stages below):

- **You can…** — observable outcomes; the stage is "done" only when all are true
- **Path** — numbered topics in exact learning order; each topic = concept + primary resource (chapter/lecture) + viz companion + Torture Test ID(s)
- **Drills** — classic exercises, in order of difficulty
- **Flagship build** — the one substantial artifact that proves the stage
- **Torture Tests** — quiz blueprint: [format · what it targets · count]
- **Traps** — the mistakes beginners here actually make (feeds quiz variants + spaced review)
- **Boss gate** — what the phase-exit quiz covers (Phase-final stages only)
- **Days** — budget at default pace

2. VS Code + C/C++ extension + Code Runner alternative: terminal workflow only — *nothing to read, just do it*

4. Warnings are truth: compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` forever — *JS warning hygiene video*
5. Terminal survival: cd, ls, mkdir, tab-completion, ↑ history — *in-build interactive terminal cheatsheet*
6. gdb first contact: break, run, next, print, step — *JS "Debugging with gdb"; trap: breakpoint before run*
7. valgrind first contact: run a leaky program, read "definitely lost" — *JS memory video*
8. git: init, add, commit, push, .gitignore — *in-build 10-minute guide*
9. Make first contact: a 5-line Makefile that builds one file — *full treatment in S05; here it's just "make works"*

**Drills:** Hello World from terminal · compile the same file with -O0/-O2 and diff godbolt output · introduce a deliberate warning, read it, fix it · set a gdb breakpoint and inspect one variable · leak 10 bytes on purpose, confirm with valgrind, fix, confirm clean.

**Flagship build:** **First Blood** — a greeting program that asks name + age and prints a formatted banner. Trivial output, but: compiled via Makefile, zero warnings, gdb-walked once, valgrind-clean, committed to git.

**Torture Tests:** [MCQ ×6 pipeline stages & flags] · [predict-output ×2 (printf, warnings)] · [tool-ordering ×2 (put gdb/valgrind/make steps in order)]

**Traps:** IDE-button dependence ("what's a terminal?") · ignoring warnings because "it ran anyway" · valgrind on Windows confusion (plan includes WSL/wine guidance) · never committing until "finished".

**Quizzes:** TT-S00-A, TT-S00-B (8 items).

**You can…** implement all six classic sorts from scratch and state each one's complexity/stability/in-place-ness from understanding; binary search in the modern robust form (half-open intervals) and its three famous variants; deploy two pointers and sliding windows.

**Path**
1. Bubble/selection/insertion — *W ch. 7.1–7.2; MS sorting series; **VA** race view*
2. Merge sort — *W ch. 7.4; recursion pays off — **PT** merge recursion visual*
3. Quick sort + partition schemes + pitfalls — *W ch. 7.7; MS*
4. **Quickselect (kth smallest) — partition without sorting** — *ADM; roadmap.sh cross-ref: kth-element*
4. Heapsort recap; counting sort concept — *W ch. 7 (non-comparison section)*
5. Binary search: canonical template, first/last occurrence, rotated-array search — *W ch. 7 + CTCI; **AV** binary search animation; the "mids and bounds" trap deck*
6. Two pointers & sliding window patterns — *CTCI/NeetCode pattern; in-build pattern cards*

**Drills:** implement all sorts + instrument comparisons · sort stability demo (structs with ties) · binary search variants ×3 each · two-sum sorted (two pointers) · longest substring without repeats (window) · **LeetCode** first 10 easy (search/sort tagged).

**Flagship build:** **SortLab** — all sorts behind one interface with a comparison-counting harness; exports a table (n vs comparisons/swaps per sort) and an ASCII bar race; stability and adaptivity demonstrated with data.

**Torture Tests:** [find-the-bug ×6: partition off-by-one, mid overflow ((lo+hi)/2!), bound drift, missing base case] · [trace ×5: array state after pass k] · [MCQ ×6: complexity/stability matrix] · [fill-blank ×4: bounds, window updates]

**Traps:** `(lo+hi)/2` overflow · infinite loop on duplicate-heavy quicksort partitions · off-by-one in half-open bounds · unstable assumptions · window shrink forgotten.

**Quizzes:** TT-S12-A/B/C/D (20 items).

### S13 · Recursion & Backtracking — *Days: 5*

**You can…** turn any "explore all options" problem into backtracking with correct pruning; trace and bound the search tree; implement subsets/permutations/N-Queens/Sudoku from patterns, not memorization.

**Path**
1. Recursion III: choose/explore/unchoose — the backtracking skeleton — *Erickson ch. on backtracking/recursion; **PT** tree-of-calls visuals*
2. Subsets & combinations — *in-build pattern card + CTCI*
3. Permutations — *CTCI; **AV** permutation tree animation*
4. Pruning: feasibility + bounding — why N-Queens finishes at all — *ADM; in-build pruning visual*
5. N-Queens — *classic; **VA** N-Queens animation*
6. Sudoku solver — *classic; constraint checks as prune*
7. Grid backtracking: rat-in-maze, path collecting — *transfers directly to S11-style pathfinding*

**Drills:** generate all subsets/permutations of small n with printouts · N-Queens with step-count comparison pruned/unpruned · Sudoku with difficulty-ranked boards · count paths in grid with obstacles.

**Flagship build:** **Backtrack Bench** — one CLI running N-Queens (n=4…12), Sudoku (3 graded boards), and maze pathfinding, each reporting nodes explored with/without pruning — makes pruning's value measurable.

**Torture Tests:** [find-the-bug ×5: missing un-choose, wrong prune condition, mutate-while-iterate] · [trace ×4: search tree counts] · [MCQ ×4: complexity of factorial vs exponential patterns] · [fill-blank ×3: choose/unchoose pairs]

**Traps:** forgetting to undo state (un-choose) · pruning condition inverted · returning a collected list while still mutating it · base-case placement errors.

**Quizzes:** TT-S13-A/B (14 items).

### S14 · Dynamic Programming — *Days: 6*

**You can…** decide "is this DP?" from problem shape; convert recursion→memo→table consciously; implement the core five families; reconstruct (not just count) optimal answers.

**Path**
1. Overlapping subproblems + optimal substructure; memoization intro — *Erickson ch. 2 (DP intro); AB DP videos; **PT** memo visual*
2. Fibonacci ladder: naive → memo → table → two variables (complexity collapse demo) — *the on-ramp everyone needs*
3. Grid paths (min path sum, unique paths) — *CTCI/NeetCode; **AV** grid DP animation*
4. Knapsack 0/1 — *Erickson; W ch. (Knapsack section); **VA** knapsack table animation*
5. Longest Common Subsequence — *Erickson; reconstruct the string, not just the length*
6. Longest Increasing Subsequence — *O(n²) then concept of O(n log n)*
7. Coin change (count + min) — *interview staple*
8. When NOT to DP (greedy works) — *bridge to S15*

**Drills:** climb stairs · house robber · coin change ×2 forms · knapsack with item reconstruction · LCS with actual sequence printout · LIS ×2 · memo-vs-table benchmark (same problem, timing + memory table).

**Flagship build:** **DPLab** — five solvers (knapsack, LCS, LIS, coin change, grid paths) each exposing: naive, memoized, tabulated variants + a table-tracer that prints the DP table filling step by step in ASCII. The tracer *is* the product.

**Torture Tests:** [find-the-bug ×5: wrong recurrence cell dependency, memo not consulted, off-by-one table dims] · [trace ×5: fill this DP row] · [MCQ ×5: identify the DP family from the problem statement] · [fill-blank ×4: recurrence lines]

**Traps:** table indices off by one (0-index vs 1-index semantics) · memo keyed wrongly · forgetting reconstruction pointer · choosing DP where greedy suffices (works but overkill) · recursion depth stack overflow — convert to table.

**Quizzes:** TT-S14-A/B/C (16 items).

### S15 · Greedy & Heaps in Anger — *Days: 4*

**You can…** recognize greedy-solvable problems and defend the choice; implement interval scheduling, Huffman sketch, and the PQ-driven patterns; justify greedy vs DP on a given problem.

**Path**
1. Greedy strategy + exchange-argument intuition (stay honest — greedy proof-lite) — *Erickson (greedy intro); ADM*
2. Interval scheduling & interval covering — *ADM; in-build sort-order playground (which order is optimal? test all!)*
3. Huffman coding sketch with your heap — *W/CLRS (Huffman section); **VA** Huffman animation*
4. PQ patterns: top-K, merge-K, two-heap median — *NeetCode pattern cards*
5. Greedy vs DP shootout — *in-build decision flowchart + drills*

**Drills:** meeting rooms / max overlapping intervals · fractional knapsack · Huffman encode/decode toy · top-K frequent via heap · streaming median (two heaps) · greedy-fail counterexample collection (when greedy breaks).

**Flagship build:** **GreedyLab** — interval tooling + Huffman codec (real file compress/decompress with your S10 heap) + two-heap median stream; each ships with its greedy-vs-DP comparison note.

**Torture Tests:** [find-the-bug ×4: wrong sort key, PQ ordering inverted] · [trace ×4: heap states, interval selections] · [MCQ ×5: greedy vs DP calls] · [predict ×2: Huffman tree shapes]

**Traps:** sorting by wrong endpoint · forgetting that greedy needs *a* reason (collect the counterexamples) · min-heap vs max-heap sign flips · two-heap invariant lost after removals.

**Quizzes:** TT-S15-A/B (12 items).
**BOSS GATE 4 (Phase 4):** 25-item exam S12–S15, ≥80% · pattern-recognition heavy; 1 fix-the-code (sliding window) + 1 trace-the-DP-table.

## PHASE 5 — INTERVIEW ENDGAME

### S16 · Interview Patterns Sprint — *Days: 10*

**You can…** map any unseen problem to a pattern within minutes, think out loud coherently, and pass mock interviews on the core 15 patterns; maintain a personal problem journal with revisit dates.

**Path**
1. The interview operating system: clarify → brute force → optimize → code → test — *Tech Interview Handbook (full read); CTCI ch. 7*
2. The 15+ core patterns mapped to problems — *NeetCode 150 roadmap as the problem source; in-build pattern cards with C-first templates; CTCI as drill source; EPI for depth. Pattern list explicitly includes: arrays/hashing, two pointers, **fast & slow pointers**, sliding window, **cyclic sort**, **merge intervals**, **kth-element/quickselect**, stack, binary search, linked list, trees, heaps, **two heaps**, backtracking, graphs, 1-D DP, greedy, **divide & conquer** (roadmap.sh cross-ref alignment)*
3. Language: C for interviews (what to do when C fights you — static buffers, helper structs) + when C++ is the pragmatic call — *in-build guidance*
4. Complexity-first communication: stating/applying Big-O out loud — *TIH*
5. Mock protocol: weekly timed mocks from day 3 — *in-build mock scripts; peer/mentor option via Exercism community*
6. Journal & spaced repetition: every solved problem gets a revisit date — *built into the app's review queue*

**Drills:** 60-problem cadence: NeetCode 150 subset (arrays/hashing → two pointers → stack → binary search → sliding window → linked list → trees → heaps → backtracking → graphs → 1-D DP → intervals → greedy), C-first; **CC Starters** Div 3/4 weekly (start contest cadence); **LC** in C by default.

**Flagship build:** **The Journal** — 60+ solved problems with your own written pattern notes + mistake tags (feeds spaced review); a personal "patterns cheat sheet" in your own words, generated from the journal.

**Torture Tests:** [pattern-ID MCQ ×10: problem statement → pattern] · [find-the-bug ×5: real interview-style buggy submissions] · [timed predict ×3] · [mock ×2: recorded self-mock checklists]

**Traps:** pattern memorization without re-derivation · silent coding (no thinking-out-loud practice) · C string/edge-case fumbles under time pressure · skipping the journal (the #1 regret).

**Quizzes:** TT-S16-A/B/C (18 items + 2 mock checklists).

### S17 · Capstone Portfolio Build — *Days: 8*

**You can…** ship one substantial, tested, documented system that survives a code review; explain every design decision in its README.

**Path**
1. Choose one: (a) **arena allocator library** with benchmark suite · (b) **mini key-value store** (your HashKV grown up: persistence + BST index) · (c) **graph pathfinder toolkit** (Pathfinder generalized: multiple algorithms + real map data) — *in-build project briefs with acceptance criteria*
2. Spec first: acceptance criteria, milestone split — *in-build project brief template*
3. Build in milestones with tests each — *S05 harness discipline*
4. Polish pass: profiling (gprof/perf intro), clang-format + clang-tidy for house style, README with design decisions, clean `make`, CI-style test script
5. Code review: self-review checklist + Exercism/mentor/peer review — *TIH*
6. Publish: repo with impeccable README + demo GIF

**Flagship build:** IS the stage. Acceptance: zero leaks under stress, zero warnings under `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic`, test suite green, README that explains *why*.

**Torture Tests:** [self-review checklist ×1] · [design-decision quiz ×5: justify your own choices — auto-generated from your README claims]

**Traps:** scope explosion (the brief caps it) · no tests until the end · README written last-minute (write it first, revisit at the end).

**Quizzes:** TT-S17-A (8 items).

### S18 · Maintain the Blade — *Days: ongoing*

**You can…** retain everything: spaced reviews keep old quizzes alive, weekly contests keep speed honest, and the habit system keeps the streak meaningful.

**Path**
1. Spaced review (SM-2-lite): the app resurfaces your weakest quizzes weekly — *built in*
2. **CC Starters** every week (Div 3/4 → climb) + occasional LC contests — *the cadence*
3. Re-implement one DS per month from scratch, timed — *the blade stays sharp*
4. Read one ADM "war story" per week — *keeps design intuition growing*
5. Streak health: use insurance tokens deliberately; tribunal reviews monthly, not just weekly

**Flagship build:** none — this stage is the metronome. Its "artifact" is a 90-day review heatmap you're proud of.

**Torture Tests:** weekly review quiz auto-composed from your spaced-review queue (dynamic).

**Advanced Horizons** (what exists beyond this roadmap — mapped to roadmap.sh's advanced branch; none are beginner requirements): Fenwick & segment trees (range queries) · B-trees & skip lists (databases) · suffix trees/arrays (string algorithms) · randomized algorithms · indexing/ISAM (DB internals) · **multithreading → the S19 concurrency & sockets extension**. When you finish S18, pick ONE horizon and go deep.

**Traps:** contest tilt (chasing rating over learning) · review decay ("I'll remember it") · habit collapse after the roadmap "ends" — that's what this stage exists to prevent.

**Quizzes:** dynamic (review-queue driven).
